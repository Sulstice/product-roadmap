![roadmap-1152x672-flip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/27068309-5b379538-5007-11e7-99fb-20f09369c672.jpg)


## Why?

Being _transparent_ about our Product Roadmap is _essential_ for
ensuring everyone is focussed on working towards the collective goal.

### Public?

From a "commercial" perspective

because being why wouldn't you make your company's product roadmap Public on GitHub?

## What?

In "Phase One" of dwyl we are building

## Who?

+ _Everyone_ is _free_ to use the dwyl application.
+ All Source Code is and _always_ will be Open available.
+ _Everyone_ is welcome to _contribute_ to the various project(s)
(_provided the contribution guidelines/workflow is respected/followed_).


## When?

We started a _while_ ago ...
We don't expect to be "_finished_"

## How?

+ [ ] Security First - ensuring the security of both the people
using the Application(s) and the (_personal_) Data in the system
is a ["hygiene factor"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_theory)
and needs to be addressed _first_ on any checklist.
