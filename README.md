# Product Roadmap

![roadmap-1152x672-flip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/27068309-5b379538-5007-11e7-99fb-20f09369c672.jpg)


## _Why_?

Having a **_clear_ Product Roadmap** is ***essential*** for
ensuring ***everyone*** is ***focussed***
on working towards the collective ***goal***.

### _Public_?

From a "commercial" perspective

because being why wouldn't you make your company's product roadmap Public on GitHub?

## _What_?

In "Phase One" of dwyl we are building a software application
to solve a _specific_ set of ***universal human needs***:

+ **Communication**
+ **Time Management**
+ ***Self-Actualisation***

> _**Most companies**/organisations are **deliberately** "**guarded**"
with their Product Roadmap for a **number** of **reasons**_:
+ _**Uncertainty** about the **future** of their **product/industry**_
(_committing to a long-range map implies a fixed/inflexible destination_)
+ _**Fear** that a "**competitor**" will "**steal**" their **ideas**_
(_and get to "**market**" **faster** thus "capturing" the "**users**".
In **some cases** this **fear** is **justified** e.g: where the innovation
is easy to replicate and difficult to differentiate,
but we **hypothesize** that being **open** and **transparent**
with our roadmap will foster a more **collaborative culture**_)
+ _**Fear** that members of their **own team** will leave
and "**steal**" their **secrets**; this happens more
[often](http://mashable.com/2017/05/20/uber-vs-google-waymo-self-driving-car-wars-get-nasty)
people realise_.
+ _**Doubt** in their **own ability** to **deliver** the plan_.


## _Who_?

+ _Everyone_ is _free_ to use the dwyl application.
+ All Source Code is and _always_ will be Open available.
+ _Everyone_ is welcome to _contribute_ to the various project(s)
(_provided the contribution guidelines/workflow is respected/followed_).

### _Who NOT_?

Who should *not* be reading this product roadmap?

Anyone who:
+ believes the World "_cannot be improved_.
+ thinks the problem of communication or time management is "_already solved_".
+ is not _obsessed_ by working on solving this _problem_ with every waking hour.
+ does **not _want_ to _learn_** what is required to build something great.
+ is not prepared to
["_**work hard every waking hour**_"](https://youtu.be/NU7W7qe2R0A)


## When?

We started a laying the groundwork for building the dwyl app _while_ ago ...
The app is undergoing constant/ongoing improvement
We don't expect the app to be "_finished_" because
there are _so many_ useful features we want to build.

Get involved and Help us prioritize which features get built next!

## How?

+ [ ] Security First - ensuring the security of both the people
using the Application(s) and the (_personal_) Data in the system
is a ["hygiene factor"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_theory)
and needs to be addressed _first_ on any checklist.
  + https://github.com/dwyl/learn-security
  + https://github.com/dwyl/ISO-27001-2013-information-technology-security

+ [ ] Offline First - everything we build needs to work offline first.


  +
+ [ ] Mobile First

  + [ ] Progressive Web App
    + https://github.com/dwyl/learn-progressive-web-apps
  + [ ] iOS Native App for iDevices (Non-PWA)

  + [ ] Apple Watch UI - while apple watch is _definately **not**_
  the platform we want to "_win_" the "_wearable tech_"
    + https://github.com/dwyl/learn-apple-watch-development

+ [ ] Distributed by `default`
  + Blockchain helps us decentralize, verify and secure the database:
  https://github.com/dwyl/learn-blockchain
  + WebRTC allows peer-to-peer (_decentralised_) communication:
  https://github.com/dwyl/learn-WebRTC

+ [ ] API: REST and RealTime (WebSockets)

+ [ ] Sharing

+ [ ] Permissions

+ [ ] Teams

+ [ ] Repeatable Checklists

+ [ ] Estimate time required for each task

+ [ ] Delegate task with checklist

+ [ ] Track time against a task

+ [ ] End Task

+ [ ] Get "Sign-off" (_Confirmation_) / Feedback on Completed Task
